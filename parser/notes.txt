I'm creating this file to keep track of this I do in this
source files

**** May 5 2014 ****
- I just thought about creating a separated
makefile for every subdir of src. I think that's 
gonna make things easier to compile

- Also, I created 'obj' folder for each subdir of src
I guess things will me more organized

- For crules directory, thigs get a little bit more complex
I'm creating a dir for every crules subfolder

- The main make is responsible for gathering the modules' 
statics libs and put bison/flex files together
